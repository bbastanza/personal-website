This is my personal portfolio website. I built it using Gatsby and relied on my React JS skills to make it all happen. I had never used a static site generator like Gatsby before and it was a fantistic developer experience. I was able to put together a prototype in a few quick hours and refined it over the span of about a week. I also used Netifly to deploy this web app which was a wonderful experience of itself. I can highly recommended both of these dev tools.

I was able to work on my CSS skills with Bootstrap4 for the styling. I have not spent much time with styling, but I was excited to work on these skills and make a site that I believe looks professional and responsive.
